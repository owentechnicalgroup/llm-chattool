The RAG system processes documents efficiently. It handles multiple document formats seamlessly. The system breaks text into manageable chunks. Each chunk is processed independently. The text splitter prioritizes breaking on periods for natural sentence boundaries. This helps maintain context and readability. The chunks can then be used for further processing. Vector embeddings will be generated in the next phase. The system logs all operations for monitoring. Each document is moved to a completed folder after processing.
